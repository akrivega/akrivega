Hello, I am Alexey Krivega; an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Astrophysics, Applied Math, and Data Science.

I'm interested in Cosmology and Particle Physics. I wish that at some point, physicist could definitively explain how our universe works starting from the from the most fundamental building blocks.

You can reach me at krivega.alexey@berkeley.edu :)
